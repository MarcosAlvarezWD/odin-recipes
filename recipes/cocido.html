        </li>
        <li>
            6 cups cold water, or as needed
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ medium head cabbage, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            4 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup uncooked orzo pasta or other small pasta
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chickpeas in a bowl and cover with plenty of cold water. Soak for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine beef shank, chicken thighs, pork belly, chorizo, beef bone, and ham bone in a pressure cooker. Cover with cold water and bring to a simmer uncovered. Skim off any foam that rises to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chickpeas and season with salt. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over the vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Adjust temperature until regulator is gently rocking. Cook for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cabbage, season with salt, and cook until cabbage is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When cook time for the meat is up, let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock lid and remove. Strain meat stock into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add orzo to the boiling stock and cook, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, arrange the cooked meat on a serving platter surrounded by chickpeas. Serve with cabbage on the side.
